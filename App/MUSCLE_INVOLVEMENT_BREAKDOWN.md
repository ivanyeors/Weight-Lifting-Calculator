## Key Principles Used in Rating

1. **Primary Movers**: Muscles that produce the main force for the movement (9-10)
2. **Secondary Movers**: Muscles that significantly assist (7-8)
3. **Stabilizers**: Muscles that maintain posture and joint stability (3-6)
4. **Minimal Involvement**: Muscles with minor roles (1-2)
5. **No Involvement**: Muscles not engaged in the movement (0)

## Factors Considered

- **Range of Motion**: How much the muscle lengthens and contracts
- **Force Production**: The muscle's contribution to overcoming resistance
- **Joint Actions**: Primary and secondary movements at each joint
- **Biomechanical Advantage**: Leverage and muscle fiber orientation
- **Stabilization Requirements**: Static and dynamic stability needs
- **Exercise Type**: Compound vs. isolation movements

## Note on Individual Variation

These ratings represent average involvement for proper exercise form. Individual factors that may affect muscle involvement include:

- Body proportions and limb lengths
- Training experience and technique
- Range of motion and flexibility
- Exercise variations and equipment used
- Load and repetition ranges

## Base Weight Factors

Each exercise also includes a `baseWeightFactor` that adjusts the ideal weight calculation:

- **0.5-0.6**: Light exercises (sit-ups, bicep curls, lateral raises)
- **0.7-0.8**: Moderate exercises (push-ups, pull-ups, dips)
- **1.0-1.2**: Standard exercises (shoulder press, bench press)
- **1.3-1.5**: Heavy compound exercises (squats, leg press)
- **1.8**: Maximum compound exercise (deadlift)

These factors account for the relative strength demands and typical loading patterns of each exercise.
